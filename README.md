## Distance Students Travel to College
Data from 350,000 U.S. high school graduates from 2014 shows that the majority of students chose to attend colleges close to home.  It's statistically rare to travel more than 100 miles to attend college.

## "Hamilton" Timeline
This is a brief history and timeline of the musical sensation "Hamilton: An American Musical" written by Lin-Manuel Miranda. The show is now touring the country, as well as still on Broadway. Over winter break, I finally got the chance to go see it for myself in Los Angeles, after years of listening to the soundtrack.

## Percentage of Female Congress Members Since 1981
The U.S. Congress currently has 535 members in the House of Representatives and Senate combined; 100 are in the Senate, and 435 are in the House.  Less than 25 percent of members are female, even though they constitute about half of the U.S. population.  The United States has a long way to go in terms of equality.

## Must Visit Cupcake Shops in the U.S.
I love cupcakes and love watching food-related shows like "Cupcake Wars." Specialty cupcake shops have been popping up across the country for years and continue to be popular.  Here are just some of the best cupcake shops in the U.S. My decision to highlight these specific shops came from reading this article in the Food & Wine magazine online. The list can be found [here](http://www.foodandwine.com/slideshows/best-cupcakes-us#1). The cupcake shops on my map and not on this list came from my own knowledge of popular stores. The photos were found using Google Image search.

## Academy Award Best Picture Winners 2010-2017
I have watched the Academy Awards every year since I can remember.  It was always an important day in my house and we treated it the way other peorple treat the Superbowl. My great uncle was actually the producer of the award show for many years so I felt, and still do feel, a special connection. I also love movies and make it a goal to wach every movie nominated for Best Picture.

## Event Photos
The inagural Greek Unity Concert was held on April 12 on the UC Front Lawn. It was a joint effort between the Panhellenic and Interfraternity Councils to promote unity among Greek life on campus after a number of chapters lost university recognition.  There was free food and t-shirts, as well as performances from student groups.
