## Distance Students Travel to College

## "Hamilton" Timeline
#### This is a brief history and timeline of the musical sensation "Hamilton: An American Musical" written by Lin-Manuel Miranda. The show is now touring the country, as well as still on Broadway. Over winter break, I finally got the chance to go see it for myself in Los Angeles, after years of listening to the soundtrack.

## Percentage of Female Congress Members Since 1981
#### The U.S. Congress currently has 535 members in the House of Representatives and Senate combined; 100 are in the Senate, and 435 are in the House.  Less than 25 percent of members are female, even though they constitute about half of the U.S. population.  The United States has a long way to go in terms of equality.
