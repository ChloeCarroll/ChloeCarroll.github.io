## "Hamilton" Timeline
#### This is a brief history and timeline of the musical sensation "Hamilton: An American Musical" written by Lin-Manuel Miranda. The show is now touring the country, as well as still on Broadway. Over winter break, I finally got the chance to go see it for myself in Los Angeles, after years of listening to the soundtrack.
